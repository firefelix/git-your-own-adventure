# Congratulations and Thank you!!

Thanks for following through til the end. I hope this was helpful!
Your changes will be merged and you will also become a contributor to this
repo!

The other great thing is, now you have a fork! So if there is a great git
command you know that didn't show up in the tutorial, you could add a section
and make a pull request so that it becomes part of the project. Alternatively, if you came across anything
while you were going through the tutorial
that was spelled wrong or linked to something that is now dead or even if you
have a better meme, you don't have to wait for me to change it! Change it yourself and then
submit a pull request with your change.

Please feel free to contribute! Issues and PRs are welcome.

There's also a list of commands found in this repo [here](../command-list.md)
